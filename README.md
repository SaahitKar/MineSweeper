# MineSweeper

This program simulates a game of MineSweeper with bombs placed in random locations around the board. Each coordinate is entered as (R,C) and the number of bombs in each row and column are displayed in the row and column. When a coordinate that's entered is the same location as a bomb, the game ends. There are methods to avoid any incorrect input from the player.
